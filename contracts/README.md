# Contracts

This subproject contains all the contracts needed for the ZK Rollup Blockchain.

Currently it only contains the [ZKRollupBlockchain.sol](ZKRollupBlockchain.sol) contract.

That contract, while still a work in progress, will in future be deployed to a public blockchain, and will be used to store and verify data sent from the private blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)

### Usage

The easiest way to edit, test and deploy the contract would be using the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) from Etherium.
